// Write an algorithm to determine if a number n is happy.

// A happy number is a number defined by the following process:

//     Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits.
//     Repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1.
//     Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy.

// Return true if n is a happy number, and false if not.
